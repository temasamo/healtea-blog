# Kagoshima Surpasses Shizuoka as Japan’s Top Tea-Producing Region

## Introduction
When people think of “Japanese tea,” Shizuoka Prefecture often comes to mind first. However, a historic change occurred in 2024—Kagoshima Prefecture surpassed Shizuoka in aracha (unrefined tea) production, claiming the number one spot for the first time since records began. This marks a significant turning point for Japan’s tea industry and reflects the diverse agricultural strategies of different regions.

## 1. Background of the Production Shift
According to Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Kagoshima produced approximately 27,000 tons of aracha in 2024, compared to Shizuoka’s 25,800 tons. This is the first time Shizuoka has lost its lead since statistics began in 1959.  
Kagoshima’s growth is attributed to its warm climate, longer harvesting period, increased production of second and later harvests, and the adoption of large-scale mechanization.

## 2. Strengths of Kagoshima
Kagoshima’s flat terrain and mild climate make it ideal for large-scale tea farming and mechanization. Popular cultivars like *Saemidori* and *Yutakamidori* are widely grown, known for their vibrant color and rich aroma. These efforts have enabled Kagoshima to meet both domestic and international demand consistently.

## 3. Differences from Shizuoka and Future Outlook
Shizuoka remains highly regarded for its first-harvest tea quality and brand value, while Kagoshima excels in production efficiency and supply stability. Moving forward, both regions are expected to leverage their strengths, balancing quality and quantity, and to explore opportunities in export markets and tourism.

## Conclusion
Kagoshima becoming Japan’s top tea producer symbolizes a generational shift in Japanese agriculture. By respecting and enhancing each region’s strengths, Japan can continue to preserve and promote its tea culture for future generations.
