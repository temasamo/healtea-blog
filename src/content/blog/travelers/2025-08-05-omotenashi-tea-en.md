## Introduction: Tea as the First Step of Omotenashi

When you arrive at a Japanese ryokan, you’re often welcomed with a **cup of tea and a small sweet** in your room.  
This moment isn’t just about refreshment after a long journey — it’s the first gesture of **omotenashi**, Japan’s unique spirit of hospitality.  
Tea is more than a beverage here; it’s an introduction to the host’s heart.

## The Spirit of Tea Ceremony and Omotenashi

Omotenashi is deeply rooted in the philosophy of the tea ceremony.  
Sen no Rikyu’s teaching of *ichigo ichie* — “one time, one meeting” — reminds us that each encounter is unique and should be treasured.  
A cup of tea in the tea room is a moment for the host and guest to connect, a tradition that continues in today’s ryokan service.

## A Lighthearted Tea Story

At one ryokan, a first-time overseas guest saw the vibrant green matcha served in a tea bowl and exclaimed:  
> **"Wow, green espresso!"**

The staff smiled and replied, “No, it’s matcha — Japanese green tea.”  
The guest laughed:  
> **"So… no caffeine kick?"**

After taking a sip, they paused, looked surprised, and said:  
> **"Definitely *not* espresso… but I’m suddenly calm!"**

The room filled with laughter — proof that even a small cup of tea can bring warmth and smiles across cultures.

## Conclusion: Hospitality in a Single Cup

Tea has the quiet power to put people at ease without a single word.  
In ryokan and onsen towns, every cup is infused with the host’s care and Japan’s cultural depth.  
And sometimes, cultural differences bring about small moments of humor that make the journey even more memorable.
