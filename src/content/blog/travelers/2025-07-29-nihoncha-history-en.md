## Heian Period: Saicho and Kukai Bring Tea from China

Tea was introduced to Japan during the Heian period (9th century).  
It is said that Saicho (founder of Tendai Buddhism) and Kukai (founder of Shingon Buddhism), who traveled to Tang China, brought tea seeds back to Japan.

Tea at that time was extremely precious and was mainly consumed as medicine among nobles and monks. It was heavily influenced by Tang tea culture and was a drink that emphasized "efficacy."

## Kamakura Period: Eisai Spreads Tea Through "Kissa Yojoki"

During the Kamakura period, the Zen monk Eisai brought tea seeds and production methods back from China again, and in 1191, he wrote "Kissa Yojoki" (Drinking Tea for Health).

> Tea is the divine medicine for health and the miraculous technique for longevity

As these words suggest, Eisai recommended tea as "medicine for health."  
Deeply connected to Zen practice, tea also spread among samurai as a means of mental concentration and health maintenance.

## Muromachi to Azuchi-Momoyama Period: Tocha, Tea Ceremony, and Sen no Rikyu

During the Muromachi period, "tocha" (tea competitions where people guessed the origin of tea) became popular, and tea gradually became more of a luxury item.

Then, during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, Sen no Rikyu appeared and perfected "wabi-cha" based on the spirit of "wabi-sabi."  
This became the prototype of today's tea ceremony.

As symbolized by phrases like "ichigo ichie" (one time, one meeting), tea evolved from a mere drink into a culture for connecting hearts.

## Edo to Showa Period: The Emergence of Sencha and Mechanization

During the Edo period, "sencha" (steeped tea) that could be easily drunk by pouring hot water appeared, and tea spread to common people.  
A person called Baisao spread sencha-do, and it became established in merchant culture.

With the Meiji period, tea manufacturing machines were introduced, and tea entered an era of mass production and export. During the Showa period, components like catechins and theanine were researched, and tea regained attention as a health drink.
