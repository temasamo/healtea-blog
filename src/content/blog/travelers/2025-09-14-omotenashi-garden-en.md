## Introduction
Japanese gardens are more than just beautiful landscapes.  

They are spaces of *omotenashi*,  
carefully designed to soothe the hearts of visitors.  

The harmony of nature, thoughtful design,  
and serene atmosphere connect deeply with ryokan and tea ceremony traditions.

## 1. The Role of Gardens in Omotenashi
Gardens act as sanctuaries, away from the noise of daily life.  

- Guests enjoy the four seasons  
- They sense the care behind the design  
- Every detail reflects a welcoming spirit  

Styles like *kare-sansui* (dry gardens) or strolling gardens  
all embody the essence of Japanese hospitality.

## 2. Ryokan and Gardens
In traditional ryokan,  
gardens often surround inner courtyards or open-air baths.  

Guests can sip tea on the veranda,  
while admiring the garden—  
a moment that perfectly symbolizes *omotenashi*.

## 3. Tea Ceremony and Gardens
The garden path leading to a tea house, called *roji*, is vital.  

Walking through it helps guests leave the ordinary world,  
and prepare for the calm atmosphere of the tea ceremony.  

This design is a reflection of hospitality itself.

## 4. A Lighthearted Story
A foreign visitor once said,  
“Wow, it looks like a giant bonsai!”  

The staff smiled and explained,  
“A garden is a small slice of nature.”  

The guest laughed and replied,  
“So… it’s nature’s bonsai park!”  
—turning the moment into a humorous memory.

## Conclusion
Japanese gardens are mirrors of *omotenashi*.  

They harmonize nature and people,  
create serene experiences,  
and prepare the heart for meaningful moments.  

Next time you visit a ryokan or tea house,  
take a moment to feel the spirit of hospitality within the garden.
