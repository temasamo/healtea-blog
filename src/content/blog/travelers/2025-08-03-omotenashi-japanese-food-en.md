## A Lighthearted Dinner Table Story

At a ryokan dinner, a first-time overseas guest pointed at a small unfamiliar dish and asked:  
> **"Is this dessert?"**

It was actually **wasabi-zuke** — pickled wasabi stems.  
The staff explained, but the guest laughed and said:  
> **"Oh! Spicy dessert!"**

They bravely took a bite… and immediately widened their eyes:  
> **"Not dessert!!"**

The entire table burst into laughter, and the warm atmosphere spread through the dining room.
