## A Lighthearted Onsen Etiquette Story

At a traditional ryokan, a first-time overseas guest tried the Japanese-style onsen experience.  
After undressing in the changing room, they carried their small towel (tenugui) into the bath area.  
But instead of leaving it outside or placing it on their head — as is Japanese custom —  
they **covered their entire body with the towel for modesty** and stepped right into the bath.

The staff quickly explained, “In Japan, towels should not go into the bath water.”  
The guest laughed and replied, “Oh, it’s for modesty?”  
Everyone chuckled, and the bathhouse was filled with a warm, friendly atmosphere.

> **Tip:** In Japan, it’s customary to keep towels out of the bathwater — place them on your head or leave them on the side.
