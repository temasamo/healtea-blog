## Introduction: Omotenashi in Harmony with the Seasons

In Japan, hospitality isn’t one-size-fits-all — it changes with the seasons.  
Ryokan and onsen towns offer uniquely curated experiences throughout the year, expressing warmth and thoughtfulness through nature, food, and traditions.  
Let’s take a journey through how Japan’s four seasons shape the art of **omotenashi**.

## A Lighthearted Seasonal Story

One winter day, a foreign guest entered their ryokan room and exclaimed:  
> **"Wow, you even have a heated orange table!"**

The staff smiled and said, “That’s a **kotatsu**, a traditional Japanese winter item.”  
Sliding under the warm table with a tangerine in hand, the guest sighed happily and said:  
> **"This is better than Netflix. I’m never leaving."**

They stayed there for an hour — cozy, content, and part of the Japanese winter experience.

## Conclusion: Hospitality That Flows with Nature

By blending tradition, nature, and heartfelt gestures, each ryokan stay becomes a unique memory.  
When hospitality aligns with the rhythm of the seasons, it touches the heart without saying a word.
