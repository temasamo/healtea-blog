## Introduction
Sake is more than a drink in Japan.  

It has long served as a symbol of *omotenashi*—  
a way to connect people, show respect, and create bonds.  

From weddings and festivals to ryokan dinners and tourism,  
sake continues to embody the essence of Japanese hospitality.

## 1. History of Sake and Hospitality
In Shinto rituals, sake known as *omiki* was offered to the gods,  
then shared among people to strengthen community ties.  

Later, in samurai and noble gatherings,  
exchanging cups became a ritual of courtesy, respect, and trust.  

- To pour for someone = to honor them  
- To drink together = to share bonds  

Sake thus evolved as a vessel of hospitality itself.

## 2. Sake in Ryokan Hospitality
At traditional ryokan,  
guests are often welcomed with local sake during dinner.  

The choice of sake reflects regional pride—  
Yamagata offers “Juyondai” and “Dewazakura,”  
while Niigata is famous for crisp, dry labels like “Kubota” and “Hakkaisan.”  

Hospitality is also found in the vessels:  

- Ceramic cups for warmth  
- Glass cups for chilled sake  
- Seasonal lacquerware for celebrations  

Even the choice of cup reflects *omotenashi*.

## 3. Manners and Etiquette
Sake comes with etiquette rooted in respect.  

### Key manners:
- Never pour for yourself  
- Hold the cup with both hands when receiving  
- Wait for everyone before drinking  
- “Kanpai” (cheers) is shared together  

These customs may surprise visitors at first.  
One guest once asked, *“Why can’t I pour my own drink?”*  
The staff explained, *“It’s our way of caring for each other.”*  
The guest smiled: *“So it’s kindness in every sip!”*

## 4. Festivals and Ceremonies
Sake also plays a role in cultural events:  

- New Year’s *otoso*  
- Cherry blossom viewing sake  
- Autumn festivals with shared cups  

Foreign visitors especially enjoy the *kagami-biraki* barrel-breaking ceremony,  
which symbolizes sharing happiness together.

## 6. A Lighthearted Story
At one ryokan, a guest asked,  
*“Give me the strongest sake you have!”*  

The hostess served a junmai ginjo at 16%.  
The guest laughed:  
*“This is strong? I expected vodka level!”*  

The hostess replied warmly,  
*“Sake is about the heart, not just the strength.”*  
The moment left everyone smiling.
