## Introduction: Space as Part of Hospitality

In Japanese ryokan and onsen towns, hospitality isn’t limited to service and cuisine — **the space itself** plays a central role.  
From architecture and lighting to seasonal decorations and natural scents, every detail is designed to welcome guests through all five senses.

---

## Architecture and Scenery

- **Traditional Japanese style**: Using natural materials like wood, plaster walls, and tatami  
- **Framed views**: Garden or mountain scenery visible from windows or verandas  
- **Flow and exploration**: Layouts that encourage walking and discovering seasonal beauty

---

## Furnishings and Decor

- Seasonal **kakejiku** (hanging scrolls) and **ikebana** flower arrangements  
- Regional crafts such as Arita porcelain, Wajima lacquerware, and kumiko woodwork  
- Local artist displays in lobbies and hallways

---

## Fragrance and Sound

- Natural aromas from tatami mats or hinoki cypress baths  
- Incense or subtle aromatherapy in the lobby  
- Nature’s own background music: flowing rivers, wind chimes, or insect songs

---

## Lighting and Shadows

- Soft, indirect lighting for a calm atmosphere  
- Warm glow from andon (paper lantern-style lamps) and washi-covered lights  
- Adjusting brightness and tone to match the season and time of day

## A Lighthearted Guest Story

One overseas guest saw the **andon** (a traditional Japanese floor lantern) in their room and asked:  
> **"Oh, is this a traditional Japanese lantern for camping?"**

The staff smiled and replied, “No, it’s for relaxing, not camping.”  
The guest laughed:  
> **"Then I’ll camp here for a week."**  

True to their word, they extended their stay and “camped” in comfort inside the ryokan.

## Conclusion: Space Speaks Without Words

In ryokan and onsen towns, hospitality is embedded in every corner of the space.  
Guests can feel the care without needing any explanation — a quiet yet powerful form of Japanese **omotenashi**.
